### Mocking, Used Sparingly

Sometimes you want to test something that depends on something else that you don't want to test that "something else". To "mock", or create empty versions of the thing we **don't** want to test, we can use the @Mock annotation above the "something else" class. We can use the @Mock annotation to create and inject mocked instances without having to call Mockito.mock manually and pass in the class.
